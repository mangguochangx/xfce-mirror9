Initial release: xfpanel-switch 1.0

    * This is the first release of xfpanel-switch. This application
      allows users to manage their panel configuration, make backups,

    * As an initial release, it is expected to be a bit rough around 
      the edges.
    * Current features:
      - Backup/Restore
      - Export/Import
      - Reading pre-installed panel configuration from /usr/share
